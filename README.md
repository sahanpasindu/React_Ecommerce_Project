# React_Ecommerce_Project - Lesson 13
We have added redux to our application so we can leverage all the benefits that come with uni-directional data flow. Instead of the prop drilling we would have to do in order to pass our new user object down deeper into our component trees from our app, we can now just connect those components directly to our redux store where we store all our data

# After you fork and clone:
Install dependencies
In your terminal after you clone your project down, remember to run either <code>yarn</code> or <code>npm install</code> to build all the dependencies in the project.
