What are Selectors?

At their most simple, Selectors are simply functions that are used to select a subset data from a larger data collection.

Selectors:
1) Have knowledge of the whereabouts or path to find a particular subset of data and
2) Return with the requested subset of data


In code:
A selector to retrieve belts from a store could look like this:
const getBelts = (state) => state.items.belts


Basic selectors (i.e simple functions that return a subset of data) are beneficial 

01) because they encapsulate knowledge of where to find that particular subset of data, 
02) they are also reusable and flexible (centerlized logics). 
03) clean our components

To see what I mean, letâ€™s take a look at an example DisplayBelts.js component that isnâ€™t using a selector to find belts.

/ Select belts from the store without use of selectos
class DisplayBelts extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return this.props.belts.map(belt => <img src={belt.imgUrl} />)
  }
}

const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return {
    belts: state.items.belts
  }
}
